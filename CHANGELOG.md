* The editMode boolean is now in a stripes-core local resource instead of a piece of React component state.

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-users/tree/v2.1.0) (2017-06-01)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-users/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0)

* When adding permissions to user or a set, only "logical permissions" (those with `visible:true`) are displayed as available to add. (But when the `listInvisiblePerms` setting is true, all permissions are still listed, as before). Fixes UIU-30.
* Towards better support for infinite-scroll paging. Not yet complete. Towards STRIPES-361.
* Settings panes are sorted alphabetically. Fixes the ui-users part of STRIPES-358.

* Delete patron-group action is always available. Fixes UIU-42.
* When a new permission-set is created, it is highlighted. Fixes UIU-1.
* Get Okapi token information from new `okapi` prop rather than context.
* Upgrade dependencies: stripes-components v0.10.0, stripes-core v1.8.0.
* Remove unused `ModuleDescriptor.json`; move relevant information into `package.json`, whence we hope future tools will extract it.
* Add Okapi interface dependencies to `package.json`: users v10.0, circulation v1.0 and permissions v3.0.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-users/tree/v1.0.0) (2017-04-10)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-users/compare/v0.0.2...v1.0.0)

* First version to have a documented change-log.
* Handles `id` field, rather than `_id`, as unique key of patron groups. Enables this module to interoperate with new versions of mod-users (since commit 022b8b8c) but of course makes it unable to run against older versions.
* Updates the permissions checked, to match what is used by folio-backend-auth v0.8.3.
